About
-----
XML/SWF Charts for CI is an open-source CodeIgniter library for simplifying the task of generating the XML used by the XML/SWF Charts tool (http://www.maani.us/xml_charts/). This library contains methods corresponding to each of the base XML nodes which are listed in the XML/SWF Charts reference. By calling the relevant methods, an XML DOM document is built up. In this way, the library hides the complexity of manually building up a DOM document to generate this XML.
